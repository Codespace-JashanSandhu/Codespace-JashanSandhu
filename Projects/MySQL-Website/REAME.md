**Front end**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A submit button to send this data to the web server for further processing.

**Back end**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- MySQL server up and running.
- A new database with a table in it.
- Table with proper number of columns.

**Getting started**
==============================================================================

## Installing XAMPP to host website and MySQL ##

1. Go to the browser and download the latest version of XAMPP.

2. Install it on your PC. Start Apache and MySQL.

3. Go to the browser and type `http://localhost`. It should bring you to the startup page of Apache server. You should be able to see the phpMyadmin portal now.

4. Click on *phpMyadmin* and you'll see the database portal.

5. Now create a *New Database* with a suitable name and a *table* with any number of columns.

6. We'll be inserting the data into these columns. So name those columns accordingly. For instance, `column1` - *username*  and `column2` - *password*.

7. Now, it's time to create a relatively simple webpage to receive data.

8. You can use the following code -

```html
<>



```
